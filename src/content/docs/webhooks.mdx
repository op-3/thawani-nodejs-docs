# Webhooks

## Setting Up Webhooks

1. Go to your Thawani dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings > Webhooks
3. Add your webhook endpoint URL
4. Save the webhook secret

## Handling Webhooks

```typescript
import express from "express";
const app = express();

app.post("/webhook", express.raw({ type: "application/json" }), (req, res) => {
  try {
    const event = thawani.webhooks.constructEvent(
      req.body,
      req.headers["thawani-signature"],
      req.headers["thawani-timestamp"]
    );

    switch (event.type) {
      case "payment.succeeded":
        // Handle successful payment
        break;
      case "payment.failed":
        // Handle failed payment
        break;
    }

    res.json({ received: true });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(400).send(`Webhook Error: ${error.message}`);
  }
});
```
